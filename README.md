# LaTeX4Linguists

A guide for linguists wanting a better document preparation tool.

This is by no means a comprehensive guide. It is, I hope, enough to
introduce you to the world of LaTeX and give you the tools you need to complete
your next assignment, report, or research paper in LaTeX.

For full documentation, visit http://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/
or a plethora of other online resources.

This guide was developed with TeX Live 2015, on a MacBook Pro (MacOS Sierra 10.12).
Please note that results may vary depending on TeX distribution and OS.
